ternary operator: is a concise way of writing conditional
                expressions.
                it is the only js operator that takes three
                operands: a condition followed by a question
                mark (?), an expression to execute if condition
                is true, followed by a colon(:) and an expression
                to execute if condition is false.
                
                condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse

            iterables objects like a arrays, stirngs, maps, sets
            & more. it allows u to iterate directly over values
            of elements, rather than dealing with the indices or
            keys.
