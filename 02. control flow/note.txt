if statement ;- is a control flow statement that provide
                multiple possible result of how a code should
                run if certain conditions are met or not.

            syntax: if (condition) {...codeblock...}
                    else if (cond..) {..codeblock...}
                    else {...codeblock...}

switch statement :- is another way to control the flow of a program.
            syntax:
                    switch (expr) {
                    case a:
                        print
                        break;
                    case b:
                        print
                        break;
                    }

for loops: is used to repeat a block of code a bunch of time.
           it sllows the iteration of data in a block of code.

    syntax:
           for (initialExpr; condition; incrementExpr-Or-DecrementExpr){COde}

the idea behind for loop is, initialExpr is used to initialise a variable as 
a counter, then the condition is set to determine how much the code should run,
then the increment or decrement is the iteration counter.


while loops:- 
        syntax:
                while(condition) {
                     codeblock
                        i++
                    }

in while the initialization of the counter is done outside the 
while statement and the incrementation of the counter is done after
the code block to avoid infinite loop.

DO while loop:-
        syntax:
                let i = 1; 
                do {
                    code...
                    i++
                } while (condition);



Logical Operators: allows us to produce and make sense to logic.
        AND:- &&
        OR:- ||
        NOT:= !
