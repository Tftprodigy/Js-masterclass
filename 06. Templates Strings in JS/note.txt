Template strings: AKA template literals, are a feature of js
            that allows to create strings with embedded 
            expressions. they are denoted by `` instead of a
            '' or "". Template stringsprovide a more flexible &
            concise wya to construct strings, especially when they
            involve variables or expressions.
            

aRROW functions:- AKA as fat arrow function, are a concise
            & shorter way to define functions in js. they
            were introduced in ECMAScript6 (ES6) & only
            provide a more compact syntax compared to 
            tradinal function expressions.

         syntax :
 (parameters) => some code

// // N/B: if the arrow function is taking a single parameter
// // getting rid of the parenthesis & the code still runs

// if a the function only has one statement, the function
// // {} can be omitted provided that it statement is written
// // in a single line.


Enhanced object literals:- are set of enchanement to the syntax
                for defining objects in js. These enhancements
                makes it more conveniet & concise to define object
                properties & methods.

DEFAULT FUNCTION PARAMEETERS: Allows assign of default values to function
                parameters. when a functionis called, & an argument is
                not provided for a parameter, the default value will be
                used instead. This feature makes it easier to handle cases
                where args might be missing or undefined.

SPREAD OPERATOR: IT TAKES an iterable i.e array and expands it
                into individual elements.
                The spread operator is commonly used to makes 
                shallow copies of js objects.
                using this operator makes the code concise and
                to read.

DESTRUCTURING: allows us to unppsck vslues from data structures (arrays,
                objects) into seperate distinct variables
